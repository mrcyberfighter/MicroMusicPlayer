1.1 Presentation from mmp (Micro Music Player)
==============================================

`mmp' is a little, minimal features, music player program with following
simple functionalities:

        + `Play', `Stop', `Pause', `Resume' music playing.

        + Playing `Next', `Previous', song control options.

        + `Shuffle', `Repeat All' and `Repeat One' features.

        + `Timeline' view, control and current elapsed time displaying.

        + `Volume' control setting.

`mmp' is an easy music folder or files playing concept music player so
that you only have to select a folder which contains some `mmp'
compatible music file(s) to play it content, or selecting a list of
compatible music files.

After listing the folder content or file(s) and searching for an cover
image to display ; `mmp' will give you full access to the music folder
content or file(s) and display the album cover image if found.

A cover image is in form of a compatible image file resized to `mmp' 3
differents, free choosable, fixed interface sizes (`little', `middle',
`big').

Then `mmp' play the folder content or the selected music files in
lexicographic sorted order (so as your O.S present you the files) or in
shuffle mode.

And the cover image is displayed, except you’re using the Minimal
interface.

You can access the playlist to choose a music file to play immediatly.

1.2 Features
============

   + `Play' a folder content.

 

   + `Play' files, to play the selected file instead of an entire
     folder.

 

   + `Display playlist':

     Display a window displaying the playable files from the folder
     content i.e the file playlist.

     The current playing music file is marked with an icon in the
     marging.

     You can double-click on a file to play it.

 

   + `Minimal interface':

     You can switch between the normal interface which present a cover
     if possible or a minimal interface which doesn’t present any cover
     image.


     note: The `Minimal Interface' looks like a car radio !

 

   + `Recent folders':

     Everytime you open music file(s) or a directory for listening
     music, `mmp' will store it

     in the recent folders list.


     note: Only the folders registered by `mmp' will appear in the
     recent folder list.

 

   + `Timeline progressbar': displaying the progress of the music file
     reading, which you can drag the slider from to change the current
     position of the music file.

 

   + `Elapsed time' of the current music file reading displaying.

 

   + `Send notification' to the user at song playing start (Not
     available on `Windows' nor `Mac' and subject of restrictions on
     `GNU/Linux').

          Warning: Restriction on `GNU/Linux' systems.

          For using Gtk notification a dbus connection is required.

          And I doubt that all `GNU/Linux' distribution use the

          DBus desktop messaging processing system.

          And notify that: I cite the Gtk documentation,

               There is no guarantee that the notification

               is displayed immediately, or even at all.

 

   + `Configure program': at your convenience.

     The `Configure program' window is divided into 3 pages:

       1. Player settings

        + You can `click-on', `click-off' the `repeat all' | `Repeat
          one' and `shuffle' mode to be set as you want.

        + You can change the `volume intensity' (from `0.0' to `1.0',
          which default to `0.5'.)  to be set as the default volume
          intensity from the program.

        + You can set the `default music folder' used when you open a
          folder, you immediately in `!'


          warning: Feature not available on `Windows' but `Windows'
          store your precedent location in the file selector.

       2. Appearance

        + You can choose the icons set to use in the interface: 2
          different sets available.

             * The `HighContrast' icon set `theme': black and white
               icons.

             * The `Oxygen' icon set `theme': colored icons.

        + You can choose the theme variant:

             + `Light'.

             + `Dark' (if available).

        + You can choose the main size from the interface from 3
          available sizes:

             * `Little' size.

             * `Middle' size.

             * `Big' size.

       3. Misc (Not available on `Windows' nor `Mac')

             * Set `Micro Music Player' as `default music player'.

             * `Reset' ‘files associations’.

             * `Enable'/`Disable' Send Notifications.

        + You can `Enable' and `Disable' the `Minimal interface' as you
          want.

          Note: Changes are immediately applied on the program,

          You must press the `Apply' button to store the settings, so
          that you can get it back at every new start from the program.

 

   + Magic behavior:

     When you press the `stop' button or your playlist is finished,

     you can simply press the `play' button to relaunch it from the
     beginning.

 

   + Current song presentation:

     The current playing song displaying entry field is formatted like
     this:

          [N°/Total] - Author - Title

You can open a folder or files with `mmp' through your file navigator or
start it with the commandline:

     $ mmp [folder|file(s)]path # mmp is a symbolic link.

1.3 What `mmp' not does:
========================

`mmp' provide nothing else features:

   + No music library indexing feature.

   + No database connection for cover images downloading or any
     indexing.

So `mmp' stay as simple as possible: as a simple `play files' or a
`folder content', with no internet connection required anyway, only your
music folder and `mmp'.

This is because i implement it at start only for personnal usage so it´s
a personnal requirement builded program,

but finally i decide to distribute it because `mmp' is so easy, as in
the concept as the short source code,

so that you can use it like this or modify it, in the way you want,
according to the terms of the `GPLv3' license.

1.5 Notes
=========

     This program, ‘mmp’ version `3.0', was written on an ‘Ubuntu 16.10’
     distribution.

     Then adapt to:

        * `Windows 7 (64 bits)', and compiled with a native
          ‘x86_64-mingw-w64-g++’ compiler.

        * `MacOS Sierra', and compiled with the native g++ compiler.

     So some functionalities are not available on some portages, very
     sorry !


     Windows: This program was tested on a `Windows 7 64 bits' system
     and should work on `Windows' versions `>= 7'.


     MacOS: This program was tested on a `Mac OS' `Sierra', I don’t know
     about retro-compatiblity and future O.S release compatiblity.

1.7.1 mmp version 2.0
---------------------

has totally change the audio engine and the images management:

Instead of using the ‘SDL2_mixer’ library it use the ‘libvlc’ library
(with which the famous media player `vlc' is build).

The ‘opencv-3.0.0’ library is no more needed.  `mmp' uses ‘gtk+-3.0’ for
the cover images resizing.

Nothing change for the user except that the program will never more
crashing due of my missuse of the ‘SDL2_mixer’ library.


File: MicroMusicPlayer.info,  Node: mmp Version 2 1,  Next: mmp Version 3 0,  Prev: mmp version 2 0,  Up: Changelogs

1.7.2 mmp Version 2.1
---------------------

Introduce some few new usefull concept.

`mmp' use some few metadatas from the files with fallback if not found
for:

       1. Formatting the displaying to the user of the current playing
          music file, in following manner:

               N° of track Artist - Title Duration

       2. Getting the duration of the music file what permit:

             + To display the duration of the music file to the user.

             + Provide a timeline bar which you can drag the slider to
               change the current position in the track.

       3. Displaying a timeline bar.

       4. Getting the correct cover image.

          Because in version below 2.1 it could append that `mmp'
          display the back face of the a cover image or any other image.


          note: It can still append but very much least as before: per
          example if `mmp' cannot access the metadata, but not
          necessarily in this case (because of fallback success).


File: MicroMusicPlayer.info,  Node: mmp Version 3 0,  Prev: mmp Version 2 1,  Up: Changelogs

1.7.3 mmp Version 3.0
---------------------


     New features:

        + Adding the `Repeat one' feature.

        + Adding the `Minimal interface' feature.

        + Adding the `Recent folders' feature.

        + Adding the possiblity to switch between the light and dark (if
          available) variant of your theme.


     Changes:

        + Reformatting the displaying to the user of the current playing
          music file, in following manner:

               [N°/Total] - Author - Title

        + The total duration of a song is now set aside the elapsed
          time.

        + `Full change of the menu bar' and many `items' and `shortcuts'
          was added.

        + `Full change of the ‘‘Configure program‘‘' window.

        + Using the `GtkApplication' instead if the traditonnal
          ‘gtk_init(...)’ / ‘gtk_main(...)’ what implies big changes.

        + Changing the `Repeat' and `Shuffle' features buttons to normal
          buttons which switch their images.

        + Adding the number of total songs of the playlist to the
          current song displaying entry wigdet.

        + Bug fix the display playlist windows, which updating was
          enterely rewritten.


     Final word:

     I have rewritten a big part of the program.

     What the user doesn’t sea, if he don’t get interest into the source
     code,

     which can be usefull for them which start the `C++' language coming
     from the `C' language.

     Because mmp always claim to be written in `C++' in a ‘C-like
     style’.

          Note: The source code is available in the folder:

          ‘/usr(/local)/share/MicroMusicPlayer/source’

          On `GNU/Linux'/`UNIX' systems.

1.8 Credits
===========

     Thanks to my beloved `mother', my `family' and to the `doctors'.

     `Stay away' from `drugs': `drugs destroy your brain and your life'.

     Thanks to my `uncle' too, who let free usage of his `Mac O.S', for
     the development of `mmp' version `1.0',

     during my holydays where i write this lines from...

          By the way `Mac O.S' seems to me a little bit strange the
          first times but i think it’s good stuff finally.

          I think that `Mac' compile right with his ‘C++ compiler’ but
          not verbose enough about errors.

          The `Mac' ‘terminal’ is near enough from the `GNU/Linux'
