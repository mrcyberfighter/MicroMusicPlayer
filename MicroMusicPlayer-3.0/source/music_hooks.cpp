       * And another timeout is created in the same manner

       for the timeline value displaying which must be updated,

       before one second have past,


       and from this I guess comes a problem:

       because (citation of the Glib documenation):

        """

        Note that timeout functions may be delayed, due to the processing of other event sources.

        Thus they should not be relied on for precise timing.

        After each call to the timeout function,

        the time of the next timeout is recalculated based on the current time

        and the given interval (it does not try to 'catch up' time lost in delays).

        """

       So we can't precise an interval which will guarantee that the 2 timeout will never be called at the same time !

       * I suppose that this 2 timeouts can collapse when called at the same moment.

         @NOTE: I don't know if this can happen, I have only remark that the program may,

                in some few case, crash, especially when it have run for a long time...


      * @FIXTRY: So I have try to fix the problem by adding a Mutex but a recursiv Mutex (GRecMutex)

                 which is: (citation of the Glib documenation)

                  """

                  The GRecMutex struct is an opaque data structure to represent a recursive mutex.

                  It is similar to a GMutex with the difference that it is possible to lock a GRecMutex multiple times

                  in the same thread without deadlock.

                  When doing so, care has to be taken to unlock the recursive mutex as often as it has been locked.

                  """


                Because a simple Mutex block all the others behaviours from the program: is not possible to open a file or folder chooser, and so on...


                And the solution of adding a pair of simple Mutex lock and unlock into

                the file and folder chooser

                is not possible since is possible that the current song may change while this toplevel windows are open !!!
